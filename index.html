          The last step in completing our map will be to add some interaction. Specifically, we will be adding mouse events using
          the `onEachFeature` option.
        </li>
        <li>
          `onEachFeature` will call the provided function on every feature--essentially looping through all of the neighborhoods.
          This is useful because we want to bind some mouse events to all of our neighborhoods.
        </li>
        <li>
          First we want to bind a pop-up so that, when we click on a neighborhood, we can see its name and which borough it belongs
          to.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also have access to a number of events we can subscribe to. We are going to set events to trigger on mouseover, mouseout,
          and click. On mouseover and mouseout we want to change the opacity of the feature so that it has a nice highlight effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our click function calls the `fitBounds()` function on our clicked feature.
        </li>
      </ul>
